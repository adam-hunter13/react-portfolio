## About Me

I was born, raised, and I still reside in Utah. Growing up I wanted to become a police officer, so when I graduated High School, I applied to Utah Valley University and started taking courses in Criminal Justice. Towards the end of my degree I decided I really didn't want to pursue a career in Criminal Justice anymore. At this point I realized I had to make a couple of decisions. I decided I was going to complete my bachelors degree in Criminal Justice, but I wasn't sure what I was going to do instead. One thing I knew for sure was I couldn't go to school for another four years. I talked with some friends who attended a Web Development bootcamp and they suggested I give it a shot. I went and watched one of them work one night for a couple of hours and it was a lot of fun. He suggested some sites that I should check out and do some studying before I commit to a bootcamp. After a few weeks I was ready to sign up for the bootcamp. I've loved it ever since!

In my free time I love to go shooting. I have a couple different firearms, and I find a lot of joy when I'm out shooting targets up in the mountains. When I'm not out shooting I can be found playing sports or video games, finding a new restaurant to eat at, or spending time with my family. Recently, I got certified to scuba dive. Scuba diving is a lot of fun, but as you may have guessed, there aren't too many places to scuba dive in Utah. I hope to travel more so I can experience more scuba diving locations.
